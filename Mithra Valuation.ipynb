    "Free cash flow is an important financial measure that shows how much extra cash a company has after paying for its day-to-day expenses and investments in things like equipment or buildings. It's like the money left over that can be used for things like expanding the business, paying off debts, or giving out dividends to shareholders. When a company has positive free cash flow, it means they're bringing in more cash than they're spending. On the other hand, negative free cash flow means they might be struggling to cover their expenses. Understanding a company's free cash flow helps investors and businesses see how financially healthy and capable they are for future growth and opportunities. To compute the free cash flow, here is the step to follow: \n",
    "    \n",
    "   - Add the Depreciation & Amortization to the net income. When calculating the net income of the company, these non-cash expenses are treated as regular expenses. However, since they don't involve actual cash outflows, we should add them to the net income to obtain a more accurate representation of the cash generated by the company during the year.\n",
    "   - Include other non-cash expenses that were considered as regular expenses when computing the net income. It's important to note that these non-cash expenses can vary among companies.\n",
    "   - Exclude the change in net working capital. Net working capital will be briefly explained below.\n",
    "   - Exclude capital expenditures, which represent the investments in capital made by the firm throughout the year. For example, if the company decides to purchase a building, it will require cash outflows. Thus, cash will decrease as these capital investments necessitate cash flows."

If the net working capital is large, it indicates that the short-term liabilities are low compared to the short-term assets. When calculating the change in net working capital, we examine how this difference varies compared to the previous year. Let's take an example to understand why we need to subtract this change from the net income in order to obtain the free cash flow.\n",

However, at the end of the second year, the accounts receivable increase to €30, while the accounts payable remain at €10. This means that there is an additional €10 compared to the first year that has not been paid by the customer yet. However, it has already been counted as revenue, even though the money has not been received. In other words, there is €10 more that is outstanding and not yet paid. To correct the net income, we need to subtract this unpaid revenue."

    "Here, we are forecasting the other labels that require a better approximation than only the mean (or median) of all past years. For instance, the COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) is specified as specific numbers since they are the result of a qualitative analysis and several estimations read in several reports. For SG&A (Selling, General, and Administrative expenses), R&D (Research and Development) expenses, other operating expenses, capital expenditures, and D&A (Depreciation and Amortization), we have chosen to only take into account some of the past years in the computation of the mean rather than all years. This is due to the fact that Mithra is a small company and therefore more sensitive to extreme values. Note that for those extreme values, taking the mean for only the significant numbers was better than the median for all numbers since the sample size for each label is small (6 observations per label), leading to a less efficient \"central tendency.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, for SG&A (Selling, General, and Administrative expenses) and R&D (Research and Development) expenses, which are operating expenses (OpEx), we have decided to reduce the ratio by 2% per year. This reduction reflects the anticipated efficiency improvement of the company over the coming years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a last modification occurs for the Income tax expenses. Indeed, it is much better to forecast the effective tax rate (Income Tax Expenses/EBIT) rather than forecast the ratio \"Income Tax Expenses/Revenues\" since it is more realistic and provides a better estimation of the tax expenses relative to the company's profitability."

Ideally, the best Fama-French model would involve using identical companies in both the HML and SMB portfolios."

We will discount them using the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), which serves as the discount rate. For all future free cash flows beyond 2028, we will utilize the perpetuity formula and assume a growth rate of 2%, which represents the target inflation rate. This perpetuity will give us the **implied Terminal Value**. The summation of this Terminal Value with the !discounted future free cash flows provides us with the **implied Enterprise Value**. It represents the estimated value of the company if we were to acquire the entire equity, repay the existing debt using the cash and short-term equivalents.\n",
